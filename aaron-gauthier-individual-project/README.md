Individual Project Contents

The document describes the contents of my individual project folder.
Code

The code contained in the Code folder are snapshots of the Code that was used in constructing the paper, gui, and powerpoint presentation for our project, as I my developed my portions or major contributions to the shared codebase.
GUI Code

For the collaborative filtering (correlation) portion, I developed a simple algorithm utilizing correlation based on the mean movie ratings aggregated by movie. The latest versions of these files, as they exist in the Group Project, can be found here:

    Demo.ui
    genGUICode
    generated_gui.py
    driver.py
    NetflixDataPanel.py

The contents of my individual file include the code file as well as the Individual Report Final Project File.

The code file contains several iterations (prototypes) of various ideas on to tackle this tough problem. The final versions and most appropriate documents to look at are as follows:


collaborative_filtering.ipynb  - final code that was used for our collaborative filtering and project report / slides

Recommender System Architectural Outline.pdf  - outline of how it should work / operate so that the GUI and other parts could be developed

recommender system requirements.pdf  - assisted in the development of the architectural outline

few_samples_netflix.csv  - used for the project data

movie_titles.txt  - used for the project to join the titles to the rest of the project data

export_data_netflix_movies.csv 

export_data_netflix_rating_mean.csv


The Individual-Final-Project folder contains some research papers that were used to shape the very simple collaborative filtering recommender system.


Collaborative Filtering Accuracy Research Study - Sweden.pdf
DataMining Final Project Proposal.pdf
QG302_087_-093.pdf
Recommender System Architectural Outline.pdf
recommender system requirements.pdf


A lot of work went into developing and exporting this simple recommender. Additionally I was investing cosine similarity which is used for "Big Data" implementations of a recommender system however I did not have enough time to figure out how to use the cosine_similarity matrix and join it with movie titles. However the code is in the collaborative_filtering.ipynb file so it can be exported and checked and used in the future. 

Here you'll find a copy of the final group project report. For additional information on who did what portion of this report, please contact myself, and he'll provide access to the google doc version control history. It didn't seem feasible to really figure out who worked on what part of this report as we all touched just about every section before pulling together the final version we're now using.

Please let us know if you have any additional questions! Cheers!
